Use TensorFlow to detect and recognize objects

# What is TensorFlow
It is an open source artificial intelligence library, using data flow graphs to build models. It allows developers to create large-scale neural networks with many layers. TensorFlow is mainly used for: Classification, Perception, Understanding, Discovering, Prediction and Creation.

TensorFlow allows developers to create dataflow graphsâ€”structures that describe how data moves through a graph, or a series of processing nodes. Each node in the graph represents a mathematical operation, and each connection or edge between nodes is a multidimensional data array, or tensor.

# OpenCV vs TensorFlow: What are the differences?

Developers describe OpenCV as "Open Source Computer Vision Library". OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing. Enabled with OpenCL, it can take advantage of the hardware acceleration of the underlying heterogeneous compute platform. On the other hand, TensorFlow is detailed as "Open Source Software Library for Machine Intelligence". TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API.

In this example, I have used tensor flow to detect and recognize objects with inference time, inference refers to the process of using a trained machine learning algorithm to make a prediction. I have also made a model and trained that model.
